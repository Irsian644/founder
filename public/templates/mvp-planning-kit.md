# MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Planning Kit

## What is an MVP?

An MVP is the simplest version of your product that delivers core value to customers and allows you to learn from real user feedback with minimal development effort.

**Key Principles:**
- Minimum: Least effort to build
- Viable: Solves a real problem
- Product: Something customers will use

---

## Step 1: Define Your Core Value Proposition

### Problem Statement
**What problem are you solving?**
[Write a clear, one-sentence problem statement]

**Who has this problem?**
[Define your target customer]

**How painful is this problem?**
- [ ] Nice to have
- [ ] Important
- [ ] Critical/Urgent

### Solution Hypothesis
**How does your product solve this problem?**
[Describe your solution in 2-3 sentences]

**What's your unique approach?**
[What makes your solution different/better?]

## Step 2: Feature Prioritization Framework

### MoSCoW Method
Categorize all potential features:

#### Must Have (Core Features)
*Essential features without which the product won't work*
1. [Feature 1]
2. [Feature 2]
3. [Feature 3]

#### Should Have (Important Features)
*Important but not critical for launch*
1. [Feature 1]
2. [Feature 2]
3. [Feature 3]

#### Could Have (Nice-to-Have Features)
*Would be nice but not necessary*
1. [Feature 1]
2. [Feature 2]
3. [Feature 3]

#### Won't Have (Future Features)
*Explicitly excluded from MVP*
1. [Feature 1]
2. [Feature 2]
3. [Feature 3]

### Feature Scoring Matrix
Rate each feature (1-5 scale):

| Feature | User Value | Business Value | Development Effort | Risk | Priority Score |
|---------|------------|----------------|-------------------|------|----------------|
| Feature 1 | 5 | 4 | 2 | 1 | 4.0 |
| Feature 2 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 2 | 3.5 |
| Feature 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 4.0 |

*Priority Score = (User Value + Business Value) / (Development Effort + Risk)*

## Step 3: User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### User Story Template
**As a [type of user], I want [goal] so that [benefit].**

   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     - [ ] Criterion 1
     - [ ] Criterion 2
     - [ ] Criterion 3

2. **As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit].**
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     - [ ] Criterion 1
     - [ ] Criterion 2
     - [ ] Criterion 3

3. **As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit].**
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     - [ ] Criterion 1
     - [ ] Criterion 2
     - [ ] Criterion 3
